Introduction

Diwali, the festival of lights, is one of the most significant festivals in India and is often associated with a surge in consumer purchases. This project aims to analyze Diwali sales data to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance during the festive season.
Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains sales information during the Diwali period, including details such as product category, price, purchase date, customer demographics, and more.
Installation

To run this analysis, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly

Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA is conducted in the following steps:

    Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the dataset and perform data cleaning operations such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

    Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.

    Customer Demographics Analysis: Analyze the demographic information of the customers, such as age, gender, and location, to identify key customer segments.

    Sales Trend Analysis: Examine the overall sales trends during the Diwali period, including daily and monthly sales patterns.

    Product Performance Analysis: Evaluate the performance of different product categories and identify the top-selling products.

    Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between different variables in the dataset to identify significant correlations.

Visualization

Visualizations play a crucial role in EDA by providing a graphical representation of the data, making it easier to identify patterns and insights. This project uses various visualization libraries to create the following plots:

    Histograms and Bar Charts: For distribution and categorical analysis.
    Box Plots and Violin Plots: For understanding the spread and outliers in the data.
    Heatmaps: For correlation analysis.
    Line Plots: For trend analysis over time.
    Pie Charts: For demographic distribution.

Conclusion

The EDA of the Diwali sales data provides valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. These insights can help businesses strategize for future Diwali sales and improve their marketing efforts.
